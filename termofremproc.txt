Yes, you can absolutely use those facts — spouse is a lawful permanent resident and child is a U.S. citizen with autism — to support a request for prosecutorial discretion (PD) or dismissal of removal proceedings, but the legal basis is slightly different than adjustment through a U.S. citizen spouse.

Here’s how you can use these facts legally and effectively:

Legal and Policy Basis You Can Use

1. Prosecutorial Discretion (PD) – Based on Family Hardship and Humanitarian Factors

While not codified in statute, ICE and DHS have long exercised prosecutorial discretion in removal cases — especially where:

The individual has deep ties to the U.S.

The person is not a public safety or border priority, and

Dismissing the case serves the public interest.


Legal Guidance:

DHS enforcement priorities (2011 Morton Memo, 2021 Mayorkas Memo – both rescinded, but courts still reference them as persuasive).

EOIR Guidance and OPLA Discretionary Dismissals (2022 memo issued under Biden administration, though officially withdrawn in 2023, many ICE offices still consider humanitarian factors informally).


You can ask ICE Office of Chief Counsel to join a motion to dismiss based on:

Spouse is a green card holder (I-130 can still be filed and approved).

U.S. citizen child with autism — this shows strong equities and potential hardship to the family if the parent were deported.

2. INA § 240(c)(4)(A) — Relief Based on Exceptional and Extremely Unusual Hardship (For Non-LPR Cancellation of Removal)

Even though this is specific to cancellation of removal, you can reference this standard to describe the level of hardship your child would suffer:

> The applicant must demonstrate that removal would result in “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse, parent, or child.



Use this language to describe the impact on your autistic U.S. citizen child.

3. Humanitarian Discretion in Adjustment (INA § 245(a))

Although INA § 245(a) doesn’t guarantee adjustment through a green card–holding spouse, if a visa number becomes available (check the Visa Bulletin), you can:

File I-130 through the LPR spouse.

Request DHS to dismiss proceedings, then apply for I-485 with USCIS once eligible.

Example Use in a Motion or Request Letter

> The Respondent is married to a lawful permanent resident and has a U.S. citizen son diagnosed with autism, whose well-being depends significantly on his father’s presence and care. Respondent has no criminal history and is not a DHS enforcement priority. In light of these strong humanitarian equities, Respondent respectfully requests prosecutorial discretion and a joint motion to dismiss under 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(c), consistent with DHS’s historical discretion policies and EOIR guidance.
